# Write-or-Die

**Write-or-Die** is designed to make essay writing more engaging for UC San Diego students, particularly those in the challenging 5-course Humanities sequence at Revelle College. This web app helps users get started on their essays by encouraging them to freely brainstorm and then uses AI to summarize their ideas. It aims to transform the writing process into a more enjoyable and productive experience.
